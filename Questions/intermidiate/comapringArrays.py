Comparing arrays helps to understand the key concepts of an array[list] in python.
Two arrays are said to be same if they contain the same elements and in the same order.
In this program we will compare two arrays to see if they are same.
If the elements of one array are the squares of elements of other arrays and regardless of the order.

INPUT:
a = [1,2,3,4,5]
b = [1,4,9,16,25]

OUTPUT:
True

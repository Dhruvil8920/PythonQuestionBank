"""
 Write a Python program to find the angle MBC (angle between the median line of a right-angled triangle)
 given the lengths of sides AB and BC
 implement the find_angle  function, which should take the lengths of sides AB and BC as inputs
 and return the angle MBC in degrees.
 Use the sine rule to calculate the angle.
 Display the calculated angle MBC in the main function after taking user input for the lengths of sides AB and BC.

INPUT:
Enter the length of side AB: 5
Enter the length of side BC: 10

OUTPUT
Angle MBC: 30.000000000000004

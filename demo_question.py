Question:
Given a list of numbers, write a Python function to return a new list that contains only the even numbers from the original list.

Example:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
"""

# Creating a Function
def get_even_numbers(numbers):
    # TODO: Implement the logic to filter even numbers from the list
    pass

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even_numbers = get_even_numbers(numbers)

# Printing Output
print(even_numbers)

'''

# Explanation:
# The code presents a problem where a list of numbers is given, and the task is to create a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. It provides an incomplete function named 'get_even_numbers' that needs to be implemented to solve the problem.
